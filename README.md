# predicting-traffic-ai
Project Description:
-------------------
The problem this project looks to solve is the ability to accurately predict the total travel time between two particular points on a Los Angeles Freeway, based on historical  data and current data. This project implements Multiple Linear Regression and Random Forest using the Python scikit-learn package, to predict the travel time. The models are trained on data from 2 separate data sets:
- Performance MeasurementSystem (PeMS): provides historical data collected by traffic sensors from freeways located in major metropolitan cities in California. This project constructs our regression models by looking at the 30.5 km route that begins in Long Beach Cal-ifornia and ends in downtown Los Angeles and follows the710-N freeway. (http://pems.dot.ca.gov/?s_time_id=1420416000&e_time_id=1420675140&route_id=85&html_x=40&report_form=1&dow_1=on&dnode=Route&content=tt&tab=tt_tod_time)
- Historical weather data set: provides historical weather data for 36 major cities across Canada, the United States, and Israel. This project uses the weather data for the city of Los Angeles to train our models. (https://www.kaggle.com/selfishgene/historical-hourly-weather-data?select=pressure.csv)

Data is taken from the 2 data sets for 2015, 2016, and 2017 and combined into one final data set with 207577 rows. This data set is available in predicting-traffic-ai/raw_data/dataset1.xlsx
